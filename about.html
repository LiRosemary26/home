  <h1>About</h1>
  <h2>&rarr;My Family</h2>
  <h3>
    Both my parents are fully Chinese. My dad had been doing particularly well with his job around the time my mom had been pregnant with me, and they decided to immigrate to Canada to have me, as they believed it to be a healthier and safer environment for me to grow up in. For the first two years of my life, I travelled all over the world with my family, until my mom became pregnant with my sister and fell seriously ill after giving birth to her. We had to move back to China temporarily so that it would be easier on my mom’s health as healthcare here in Canada would be more complicated as she hadn’t become a Canadian citizen yet at the time. My mom’s parents were also back in China, so while my mom was getting treated, they would be able to help out with taking care of my sister and me. From then I had been jumping around; attending kindergarten in both China and Canada. I later settled in China for a short while and attended first and second grade, and I moved back to Canada after second grade and directly skipped over third grade into fourth grade due to my late birthday because of how sorting grade by age worked differently back in China.
